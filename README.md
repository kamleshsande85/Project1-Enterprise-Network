# Project1-Enterprise-Network

**Enterprise Network Design and Security Audit project for CCNA prep**

## 📚 Project Overview

This project is designed to help with CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) exam preparation by providing hands-on experience in enterprise network design and security auditing. It covers core networking concepts, such as network topology, IP addressing, routing, switching, and security best practices.

## 🗂️ Contents

- Network design diagrams
- Device configuration files
- Security audit checklist
- Troubleshooting notes
- Lab exercises

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
